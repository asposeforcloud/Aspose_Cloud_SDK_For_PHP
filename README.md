### Data

In order to manipulate any files, you first need to upload them to the Aspose Cloud storage using Storage module. 

### Output

The Aspose Cloud SDK for PHP allows you to save the output files at your specified location.

Make use of the EventDispatcher
-------------------------------

The SDK allows you to alter the calls made by [connecting `EventListeners`](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher/introduction.html#connecting-listeners). You can simply register a php callable in your code by using the following example:

```php
use Aspose\Cloud\Common\AsposeApp;
use Aspose\Cloud\Event\ProcessCommandEvent;

$dispatcher = AsposeApp::getEventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->addListener(ProcessCommandEvent::PRE_CURL, function (ProcessCommandEvent $event) {
    // will be executed when the ProcessCommandEvent::PRE_CURL event is dispatched
    curl_setopt($event->getSession(), CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 60); 
});
```

The SDK currenlty dispatches the following events. Please use the Event class constants in your code to register to the specific events.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Module</th>
<th>Event names</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Utils</td>
<td>ProcessCommandEvent::PRE_CURL</td>
<td>Allows you to alter the curl session before the call is executed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Utils</td>
<td>ProcessCommandEvent::POST_CURL</td>
<td>Allows you to alter the curl session and response after the curl request is executed, but before the curl session is closed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Utils</td>
<td>ValidateOutputEvent::VALIDATE_OUTPUT</td>
<td>Allows you to add extra validation on the result, by altering the invalid variable.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pdf & Document</td>
<td>SplitPageEvent::PAGE_IS_SPLIT</td>
<td>Triggers after a SDK split call, for each page that was split. This allows you to use the `$outputFile` and `$pageNumber` directly after it was saved by `Utils::saveFile`.</td>
</tr>
